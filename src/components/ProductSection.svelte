        The same tech used by astronauts and medical professionals to prevent

        but it also is a leading cause of foot-rot. With Silverlight socks we’re
        creating a bacteria-free zone around your feet for blister-free hiking
        bliss without the bad smell.

      To prevent blisters from having a chance, you need a sock that dries fast
      &amp; wicks sweat, doesn’t ever move (no bunching, slipping, rubbing), has
      support and padding and keeps bacteria away from your feet. With
      Silverlight socks we are the first to be able to solve all this problems
      at once in a single sock. By creating a padded-dual-layer sock with
      compression to prevent movement, with silver yarns to keep bacteria at bay
      and sweat-wicking and faster drying time than traditional merino wool
      hiking socks, thanks to a deliberate balance of a merino wool and silver
      yarn inner layer and nylon and spandex outer layer.

      Gone are the days of taking your socks off after a days hike – to give

      the work in preventing blisters from ever having the chance to form. We
      are proud to say that Silverlight socks completely eliminate every major
      cause of blisters, whether you’re running or hiking.

        same time constructed to exacting standards that both layers would work
        in tandem to support, aerate, and comfort the foot. We’re happy to say
        after hundreds of hours of testing with some serious time on the trail
        we have custom designed that perfect balance.

        closer to being completely blister free. Thanks to the outer Nylon

            There are very few factories in the world who are able to work with
            silver yarns and can produce dual-layer socks with compression at
            the same time. It requires state of the art machinery, that’s just
            been available in the last few years as well as knowledge how to
            blend silver yarns into the socks, a delicate process.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have been testing factories throughout the world and we found
            only one that was able to produce Silverlight socks in the quality
            we require, a small specialized factory in China. Out of 15
            factories, 8 of them in China, we were left only with one who is
            able to produce the socks that so many of our customers fell in love
            with. For a more detailed explanation, we wrote a blog post about <a

            Our production price is about twice as high as for socks that don’t
            contain silver. Silver is a very expensive material, but we believe
            strongly that to make the best hiking socks possible, silver yarn
            has to be part of the equation. Unlike most other brands we offer
            free worldwide shipping even for the first pair. By utilizing a
            direct to consumer (DTC) model without middlemen and savings for
            shipping when sending multiple pairs in one package, we are able to
            offer our socks for a similar price as other high-end hiking sock
            brands, for purchases of 3 pairs, even though we have much higher
            production cost. We sell 5-packs at an even greater discount,
